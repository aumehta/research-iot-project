# University Project Report: People detection through BLE signal and Machine Learning Models 
In this project, we used ML models to assist with people detection to ultimately save energy. The question we will answer with the ML model is that at any given time, given 4 strength values (collected from 4 different devices), can it accurately predict what the corresponding label would be.
